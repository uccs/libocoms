# This is the VERSION file for Open MPI, describing the precise
# version of Open MPI in this distribution. The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>. If release is zero, then it is omitted.

major=1
minor=0
release=0

# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags. If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number. It does not have to be
# numeric. Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1),
# b1 (beta release 1), sc2005 (Super Computing 2005 release). The
# only requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII
# characters and have no white space.

greek=a1

# If want_repo_rev=1, then the repo revision number will be included
# in the overall Open MPI version number in some form.

want_repo_rev=1

# If repo_rev=-1, then the repository version number will be obtained
# dynamically at run time, either:
#
# 1) via the "svnversion" command (if this is a Subversion checkout)
# in the form "r<svn_r>", or
# 2) via the "hg -v -R tip" command (if this is a Mercurial clone)
# in the form of "hg<hash>", using the hash tag at the tip
# 3) via the "git log -1" command (if this is a Git clone) in the form
# of "git<hash>", using the hash tag at the HEAD
# 4) with the date (if none of the above work) in the form of
# "date<date>".
#
# Alternatively, if repo_rev is not -1, the value of repo_rev_r will
# be directly appended to the version string. This happens during
# "make dist", for example: if the distribution tarball is being made
# from an SVN checkout, if repo_rev=-1, then its value is replaced
# with the output of "svnversion".

repo_rev=-1

# The date when this release was created

date="Unreleased developer copy"

# The shared library version of each of Open MPI's public libraries.
# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation. The
# first Open MPI release to programatically specify these versions was
# v1.3.4 (note that Libtool defaulted all prior releases to 0:0:0).
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the Open MPI
# release managers (not individual developers). Notes:

# 1. Since these version numbers are associated with *releases*, the
# version numbers maintained on the Open MPI SVN trunk (and developer
# branches) is always 0:0:0 for all libraries.

# 2. The version number of libmpi refers to the public MPI interfaces.
# It does not refer to any internal interfaces.

# 3. Similar to libmpi, libmpi_f77, libmpi_f90 (and possibly other
# Fortran libraries someday -- shrudder!), the version number refers
# to the public MPI interfaces. Note that there have been typo fixes
# in the parameter types to libmpi_f77 functions over time; these
# technically did not change the interface because Fortran 77 does not
# link by parameter type.

# 4. Similar to libmpi, libmpi_cxx's version number refers to the
# public MPI interfaces. Note that this version number may or may not
# be affected by changes to inlined functions in OMPI's
# header-file-based C++ bindings implementation.

# 5. The ORTE and OPAL libraries will change versions when their
# public interfaces change (as relative to the layer(s) above them).
# None of the ORTE and OPAL interfaces are public to MPI applications,
# but they are "public" within the OMPI code base and select 3rd party
# software packages.

# Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.

# "Common" components install standalone libraries that are run-time
# linked by one or more components. So they need to be versioned as
# well. Yuck; this somewhat breaks the
